<h1>Mentorship Project</h1>
<p>This project is a social platform made for students of a university. At the beginning, it was made for Marmara University students, then published as an open source project. Generally, computer engineering students use this for now. Our aim is to use for students of any department. A new student who has questions about school, campus life, teachers, and lectures is able to ask them to another student who has experience about these cases and he is called mentor. All students has been matched by considering their personality and knowledge.</p>
<p>Project has multi-language support. (English and Turkish available for now) Front-end of the project was made by using Bootstrap and back-end is full PHP with Laravel framework and MySQL database. By using benefits of Laravel, it can be connected to other database systems such as PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.</p>
